The trajectory details the development of the Oath V2 Mobile App, starting from a bootstrap phase to a comprehensive Gate A 2.0 feature set. Initially, the AI engineer established an Expo + Expo Router base with a tokenized design system, facing and resolving several dependency and routing conflicts, including a critical issue where  conflicted with , and missing React Navigation packages.

Subsequent commands focused on building out the UI shell, enhancing the design system with reactive stores (), and implementing core screens like Home, Calendar, Sparks, and Ledger. This included complex UI elements like grouped lists, segmented controls, a glass tab bar (), and an HLS progress ring ().

A significant challenge was the upgrade to Expo SDK 53, which caused Metro bundler compatibility issues, specifically  errors. This was resolved by a meticulous clean reinstall, pinning React Native to a compatible version (0.79.5), and reinstalling all dependencies with Expo's SDK-aware resolver. The final commands refined visual fidelity, introduced swipe-to-delete functionality (), and polished the Calendar and DaySheet designs. The work is currently in progress on the Calendar Polish command.

The Oath V2 Mobile App is a mobile-first application built with Expo and Expo Router, featuring a tokenized design system and reactive state management. The core purpose is to establish a robust, modern mobile application base capable of layering complex UI/logic safely.

Key features implemented and planned:
-   **Bootstrap**: A clean Expo + Expo Router base with a tokenized design system and a  self-test screen.
-   **Design System**: Token-only styling (no raw hex values in components) with light/dark theme support, expanded palette (glass, pillBg, backdrop), and comprehensive typography scales, radii, and spacing.
-   **State Management**: Reactive stores for  (oath items with CRUD, status, datetime) and  (first day of week, time format, intensity, quiet hours, channels, SMS bank, default times, theme) using  for immutable updates.
-   **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation () for Home, Calendar, Sparks, and Ledger, with a separate Settings screen accessible via a SideMenu (hamburger icon). Root of the app redirects to .
-   **Home Screen**: Features a large title header, a hero  for adding new items (with a right-sided mic chip), segmented filters (All, Action, Time, Anchor, Memory), and a grouped list displaying items under Today, Upcoming, and Later headers, including status and time chips. Supports swipe-to-delete and long-press to toggle completion.
-   **Sparks Screen**: Displays ideas/thoughts with segmented sorting (Sparks, Type, Clusters) and  components that allow converting a spark into an item or archiving it.
-   **Calendar Screen**: Displays a Month grid with mini-bars indicating activity per day, respecting  setting. Tapping a date opens a . Week and 3-month view shells are present.
-   **DaySheet**: A modal for a selected date, showing existing items, with a quick-add input for new items (defaults to morning time).
-   **Ledger Screen**: Features an  (HLS = Honored, Later, Sparked - conceptually for the app's honor system) to display completion percentage, This week: honored X / Y stats, and a weekly grouped list (Today, Yesterday, Earlier) of items.
-   **Settings Screen**: Comprehensive sections for Intensity, Quiet Hours (toggle, start/end times), Channels (Push/SMS toggles, SMS Bank meter), Default Time Buckets, Display (Time Format, First Day of Week), and Theme.
-   **UI/UX Principles**: Emphasis on thumb-friendly, contextual, glanceable, gesture-driven, progressive, accessible, responsive, and predictable interfaces.
-   **Technical Constraints**: Expo SDK 53+, Expo Router, React Native components, TypeScript, Ionicons only,  for gestures,  for glass effects,  for charts. No external services or persistence beyond local stores in this phase.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was working on . This command aims to finalize the Calendar visuals and flows to match mockups, including a polished Month grid with activity mini-bars, a redesigned  for date-specific item management, and visual shells for Week and 3-Month calendar views. It also includes the integration of settings for  and default times for adding items.

So far, the following actions have been taken in :
1.  Installed  (though it was already present, the command intended to ensure it).
2.  Created or overwritten the following files:
    *    (to ensure canonical redirect to )
    *    (expanded  type with new fields like quiet hours, channels, default times, theme)
    *    (the SVG ring component for Ledger)
    *    (updated to integrate  and weekly grouping)
3.  Created the calendar screen () and the DaySheet component ().
4.  Encountered an error trying to   as it already existed, and subsequently used  to overwrite it with the expanded settings UI.
5.  Fixed a TypeScript error in  related to  not being assignable to  in  call.
6.  Restarted the Expo server via supervisor and successfully compiled.
7.  Captured screenshots for , , , and a screenshot for  to verify the new features. All checks passed.

The work for  is complete, and all required screenshots and QA checks have passed. The app now features a fully functional Calendar with Month view, DaySheet, Ledger with HLS ring, and expanded Settings.
